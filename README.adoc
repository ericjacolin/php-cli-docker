= PHP CLI on Docker

== Objectives

* A PHP executable on Docker, to run PHP scripts on the fly with php-cli
* Create the container and remove it immediately after the script execution
* To test particular PHP versions, configurations, extensions and build processes

== Build the image

* 7.4-large: includes exact same libraries as used in the Quoteguy web app, notably libraries for dynamic image generation

----
docker build -f Dockerfile.7-4-large \
    -t php-cli:7.4-large \
    .

== Create command line alias

To create a permanent Bash alias:

* Open `~/.bash_aliases` (create if does not exist)
* Append `alias php1='docker container run --rm -v $(pwd):/app/ --user $(id -u):$(id -g) php-cli:7.4-large'`
* Save and close the file
* Activate alias by executing `source ~/.bash_aliases`

== Tests

php1 -f tests/inkscape.php
php1 -f tests/yaml.php

== Executing scripts

Just go to the directory with your code and run:

`docker container run --rm -v $(pwd):/app/ --user $(id -u):$(id -g) php-cli:7.4-large test.php`

or with the alias:

`php test.php`

* `--rm` will remove the container after execution
* `-v $(pwd):/app/` will mount the current directory as volume
* `php-cli-docker:74-large` is the image
* `test.php` is the command which will be executed after the container is created
* `test.php` is the script to execute
* In general we want file outputs to have the same permission as the local user $USER. Hence the `--user $(id -u):$(id -g)` option.
* Ensure the directory where you want to write on the host has permissions 0777.
